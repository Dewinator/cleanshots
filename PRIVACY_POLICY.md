# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** January 15, 2025  
**Last Updated:** January 15, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Clean Screenshots ("we," "our," or "the App") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring complete transparency about our data practices.

**Key Principle: Your data never leaves your device.**

## 2. Information We Do NOT Collect

Clean Screenshots is designed with privacy-first principles. We do NOT collect, store, or transmit:

- ❌ Your screenshots or images
- ❌ Text extracted from your screenshots  
- ❌ Personal information or identifiers
- ❌ Usage analytics or tracking data
- ❌ Device information beyond what's required for basic functionality
- ❌ Location data
- ❌ Contact information
- ❌ Any data to external servers or third parties

## 3. How Clean Screenshots Works

### Local Processing Only
- **OCR (Text Recognition):** All text extraction from screenshots happens entirely on your device using Apple's Vision framework
- **AI Categorization:** Screenshot categorization algorithms run locally on your device
- **Duplicate Detection:** Image comparison and duplicate identification occurs only on your device
- **Data Storage:** All app data is stored locally in your device's secure app sandbox

### No Internet Connection Required
Clean Screenshots functions completely offline. The App does not require an internet connection for any of its core features.

## 4. Permissions We Request

### Photo Library Access
**Purpose:** To import and organize your screenshots  
**Scope:** Read and delete access to screenshots only  
**Usage:** 
- Import screenshots from your photo library for organization
- Delete screenshots when you choose to remove them
- Create thumbnail previews for the App interface

**Important:** We only access screenshots (images marked as screenshots by iOS). We do not access other photos, videos, or media in your library.

## 5. Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage
- All app data is stored locally on your device
- Data is protected by iOS's built-in security features
- Information is stored in the App's secure sandbox environment
- Data is automatically encrypted by iOS's file system encryption

### No Cloud Synchronization
- Clean Screenshots does not sync data to iCloud or any other cloud service
- Your screenshots and extracted text remain exclusively on your device
- Uninstalling the App permanently removes all associated data

## 6. Third-Party Services

Clean Screenshots does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## 7. Children's Privacy

Clean Screenshots does not knowingly collect information from children under 13 years of age. The App is designed for general use and does not target children specifically.

## 8. Your Rights Under GDPR

As Clean Screenshots processes all data locally on your device, traditional GDPR data subject rights are inherently protected:

- **Right to Access:** All your data is visible within the App
- **Right to Rectification:** You can edit or correct any data within the App
- **Right to Erasure:** You can delete any data within the App or uninstall the App entirely
- **Right to Data Portability:** Data remains on your device and can be exported if needed
- **Right to Object:** You control all data processing within the App

## 9. Data Retention

- Screenshot data and extracted text are retained until you choose to delete them
- Uninstalling Clean Screenshots permanently removes all app data
- No data is retained on external servers (because none is transmitted)

## 10. International Data Transfers

Since all data processing occurs locally on your device, there are no international data transfers.

## 11. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes through the App Store update notes. Your continued use of Clean Screenshots after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.

## 12. Technical Implementation

### Apple's Vision Framework
Clean Screenshots uses Apple's built-in Vision framework for text recognition. This framework:
- Runs entirely on-device
- Does not send data to Apple's servers
- Is part of iOS's privacy-focused architecture

### Core Data/SwiftData
Local data storage uses Apple's SwiftData framework:
- Data is stored in SQLite databases on your device
- Protected by iOS's app sandbox security
- Automatically encrypted by iOS

**Privacy Promise:** Clean Screenshots is built on the principle that your personal data belongs to you. We've architected the entire application to ensure your screenshots, extracted text, and usage patterns never leave your device. This isn't just a policy statement—it's how the App fundamentally works.
